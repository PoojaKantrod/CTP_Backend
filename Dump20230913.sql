I am an undergraduate student attending Northeastern University in Boston and I am originally from Virginia. I really enjoy the city life and constantly being \'on-the-move\' with one thing or another.','At Northeastern University, I am persuing a Bachelors of Science in Economics and Pshychology. I have always been fascinated with Human Pshychology and behavior and my academic interest in it flourished when I took an introductory Psychology class at my High School. At a time like this, when focus on human behavior and mental health are finally getting the attention they deserve, I wanted to study this in a way that I can apply it to everyday life. The Economics and Pshychology program at Northeastern allows me to study the complexity of human behavior in an economic context. Throught this, I can help implement the topics such as cognition, behavior, decision making, and motivation in any field as economics connects the whole world.','Along with academic courses, I involve myself in various other activities on and off campus. I am a leader in the Economics Society at Norhteastern and a member of Alpha Phi Omega. Through these organizations, not only am I able to develop my skills and knowledge, but I also connect with like minded individuals that have a similar goal for their future. I also participate with the Campus center on Violence Against Women and Vegetarians United. It is great to be part of work that is actively seeking to make a difference in the world. I am continuously trying to find new ways to apply my skills and knowledge and to learn new things.','I also enjoy playing Tennis and Basketball with the on-campus club teams. I have been a physcially active person since I was very young and sports are one of my favorite activities.','In the near future, I wish to increase my knowledge and experience by studying further in pshychology. Meanwhile, I would like to work with psychiatrists and scientists working to understand mental health and human behavior in relation to the corporate world. Eventually, I would like to work with top level executives in companies of all industries to evaluate human pshychology and make decisions accordingly in this coporate world.','I have been fortunate to have been a Pshychology Intern at Boston Medical Center my second summer of college. Currently, I am working on Health Economics & Outcomes Research at Takeda Pharmaceuticals in Boston.','','I am fluent in 3 languages including English, Irish, & French.

I love the earth, the ukulele, fruit, the way music and movement makes me feel. I love the night time when the world is quiet and the day time when the sun is up and the world is busy, and people seem ready to feel alive. I want to support people, specifically youth, in finding their voice and making space for them to express themselves in a safe and open way.\n\nCities are big and they are crowded. They hold so many people and this means that sometimes some can fall through the cracks. As children and young adults in the city grow they can often find themselves lost in unstable home lives and the chaos of the public school system. There is often no where for these growing people to feel safe, cared for, and nurtured. I want to help to create a place, to create a city, to create a world where children feel seen and welcome to be themselves and express their loves.','For most of my life I have lived in Brooklyn, New York. I made my way through public school here. When I look back I think of what a struggle school was for me and for most of my peers. How can public school transform from a system that simply tries to move students through into a place of true engagement and learning? \n\nAfter high school I found myself attending Goucher College in Baltimore, Maryland, where I honed my love for poetry and met many friends whose strength, perseverance, and sweetness inspires me to this day. As beautiful as the people were there, I was struggling with my mental health and I decided to take a year off to volunteer on organic farms across the U.S. This stoked my love of nature and animals. It gave me the gift of finding confidence in my ability to learn. \n\nFor the second half of 2019 I worked at Whole Foods, which taught me to live in the moment and that kindness is often found in the smallest of actions. Now I am studying at Smith College hoping to convince everyone that education isn\'t a clear cut path.

I believe that one can only truly help another if they have worked on healing themselves. I am using this time of my life to learn, to work, to express and understand myself and those around me. I do this so in the future I can support others in doing the same.\n\nI do small things like make sandwiches for the local food bank, visit my neighbors in the nursing home across the way, hand out cookies and Snickers on the street, and make my friend\'s small gifts to show that they are loved. But I truly believe that the most beautiful and important thing that I do for the world is work on myself. Every moment matters and every action has an outcome. If I am healthy and happy then each person I meet will feel that and this will create a huge ripple in the world.','','','','','','','','','','','','','','','','','','Student Organization: Writers Flock, Position (if any): Member\nStudent Organization: Bird Watching , Position (if any): Member','','','','','','','','','','','','','','','','','','','','','','','','','','','','','','','','','','','','','','','','','','','','','','','','','','',0,4),('Infl-college-student-0000288','Abigayle','','Chase','#S-1343113','chasea@mail.gvsu.edu','3/9/2000','https://ucarecdn.com/432cac60-0318-4d4d-a04f-e32309bcceb2/-/resize/200x200/','','','',2022,'','I am currenly a junior at Grand Valley majoring in international relations and a minor in biology.

McCain–Feingold restricts the amount of money given to political parties, which had become a way for companies and PACs to exert influence. It placed limits on total contributions to political parties, prohibited coordination between candidates and PAC campaigns, and required candidates to include personal endorsements on their political ads. The Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 (BCRA), also referred to as the McCain–Feingold Act. McCain–Feingold restricts the amount of money given to political parties, which had become a way for companies and PACs to exert influence. It placed limits on total contributions to political parties, prohibited coordination between candidates and PAC campaigns, and required candidates to include personal endorsements on their political ads. It also limited advertisements run by unions and corporations. Soon after the passage of the McCain–Feingold Act, the FEC’s enforcement of the law spurred court cases challenging it. The first, McConnell v. Federal Election Commission (2003), resulted in the Supreme Court’s upholding the act’s restrictions on how candidates and parties could spend campaign contributions. But later court challenges led to the removal of limits on personal spending and ended the ban on ads run by interest groups in the days leading up to an elections. The history of campaign finance monitoring has its roots in a federal law written in 1867, which prohibited government employees from employees.','I major in finance. My favorite class so far is Communication 1010 class out of all the general Ed’s. The Professor allows us to do any specific topic that we want, except very controversial ones, in exchange that we follow his speech outlines. We get to talk about the things that we love, hate, dislike, or like passionately with the class listening and getting to know every one of us. I get to open up myself indirectly through this effective way without keeping my usual guarded posture and face where I tense if I have to be This, however, pales in comparison to the amounts raised by political action committees (PACs), which are organizations created to raise and spend money to influence politics and contribute to candidates’ campaigns. In the 2014 congressional elections, PACs raised over $1.7 billion to help candidates and political parties.[10] How does the government monitor the vast amounts of money that are now a part of the election process?\n\nThe history of campaign finance monitoring has its roots in a federal law written 1867, which prohibited government employees from asking Naval Yard employees for donations. Republican Party spent about $16 million overall, which includes William McKinley’s $6–7 million campaign expenses.','I was a writer and editor for my high school newspaper (The Verdict). I collaborated and directed articles for every monthly newspaper. I always pitched ideas for every article that was relevant and not too controversial. I directly corresponded to my English teacher as she was the advisor for anything in relation to the tasks at hand. I made sure to distribute the tasks between me and my partner or group members in order to meet the deadlines for each article.\nCampaign managers know that to win an election, they must do two things: reach voters with their candidate’s information and get voters to show up at the polls. To accomplish these goals, candidates and their campaigns will often try to target those most likely to vote. Unfortunately, these voters change from election to election and sometimes from year to year. Primary and caucus voters are different from voters who vote only during presidential general elections. Some years see an increase in younger voters turning out to vote. Elections are unpredictable, and campaigns must adapt to be effective. Even with a carefully planned and orchestrated presidential run, early fundraising is vital for candidates. Money helps them win, and the ability to.','I play tennis, badminton, and basketball. I also love to bike around my neighbor at least once a week. Walking around my college campus in Manhattan is an exercise that is worth it enough to explore the whole city for you could never go hungry with excitement to fill it up. I am still learning how to swim so that I could play with people my age who know how to swim well.\nAlthough candidates have the same goal for primary and general elections, which is to win, these elections are very different from each other and require a very different set of strategies. Primary elections are more difficult for the voter. There are more candidates vying to become their party’s nominee, and party identification is not a useful cue because each party has many candidates rather than just one. In the 2016 presidential election, Republican voters in the early primaries were presented with a number of options, including Mike Huckabee, Donald Trump, Jeb Bush, Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio, John Kasich, Chris Christie, Carly Fiorina, Ben Carson, and more. (Huckabee, Christie, and Fiorina dropped out relatively early.) Democrats had to decide between Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders, and Martin O’Malley (who soon dropped).','I wish to be financially stable with all of the knowledge that I am willing to learn, remember, and use in real life so that I could retire early without worrying over debt and family financial problems. If I am able to and could do so, I wish to have all the time in the world to brush up on my hobbies of creative writing, art, and athletic hobbies to make something of them out in the public for these services using commissions. \nFirst, name recognition is extremely important. Voters are unlikely to cast a vote for an unknown. Some candidates, like Hillary Clinton and Jeb Bush, have held or are related to someone who held national office, but most candidates will be governors, senators, or local politicians who are less well-known nationally. Barack Obama was a junior senator from Illinois and Bill Clinton was a governor from Arkansas prior to running for president. Voters across the country had little information about them, and both candidates needed media time to become known. While well-known candidates have longer records that can be attacked by the opposition, they also have an easier time raising campaign funds because their odds of winning better.','I have held no jobs so far. But I do have work experience for Changing the Present only. I have managed a project on my own where I researched and analyzed information and contact information for the College Scholarships for High School Students spreadsheet. I was the one who handled communication between Robert and the team members in the Active Projects for SYEP. From the SYEP project spreadsheet, I also made sure to correct all the data entry errors that I saw.\nEarly in the 2016 election season, several candidates had fundraised well ahead of their opponents. Hillary Clinton, Jeb Bush, and Ted Cruz were the top fundraisers by July 2015. Clinton reported $47 million, Cruz with $14 million, and Bush with $11 million in contributions. In comparison, Bobby Jindal and George Pataki (who both dropped out relatively early) each reported less than $1 million in contributions during the same period. Bush later reported over $100 million in contributions, while the other Republican candidates continued to report lower contributions. Media stories about Bush’s fundraising discussed his powerful financial networking, while coverage of the other candidates focused on their lack of money. Donald Trump, the eventual Republican nominee, showed a comparatively low fundraising because he was self-funded.','Critical thinking','English - Native or bilingual\nChinese Mandarin - Limited Working\nSpanish - Basic\nTagalog - Basic\nKorean - Basic\nPortuguese - Basic\nRwanda - Basic \nSamoan - Basic \nSanskrit - Basic\nSerbian - Basic \nShona - Basic\nSindhi - Basic\nSinhala - Basic\nSlovak - Basic\nSlovene - Basic\nSomali - Basic\nSwahili - Basic \nSwedish - Basic \nTachelhit - Basic \nTagalog - Basic \nTajiki - Basic \nTamil - Basic \nLatin - Basic\nHebrew - Basic\nRussian- Basic\nFuzhounese- Basic\nChinese Cantonese - Basic\nGreek - Basic\nJapanese - Basic\nFrench - Basic\nGerman - Basic\nArabic - Basic\nItalian - Basic\nDutch - Basic\nMalay - Basic\nRomani - Basic\nTurkish Languages - Basic\nDanish - Basic\nFaroese - Basic\nSwedish - Basic\nFinnish - Basic\nNordic Languages - Basic\nIcelandic - Basic\nJavanese - Basic\nBahasa Indonesian - Basic\nHindi- Basic\nUrdu - Basic\nPersian Farsi - Basic\nKazakh - Basic\nCreole - Basic\nMaya Languages - Basic\nNahuatl- Basic \nTsonga- Basic\nLomwe- Basic\nNepali- Basic\nPunjabi - Basic\nFilipino- Basic\nChinese Hakka - Basic\nFrench Creole - Basic\nYiddish - Basic\nPanamanian English Creole - Basic\nJamaican English Creole - Basic\nHungarian - Basic\nSamoan - Basic\nAmerican Sign Language - Basic\nChinese Sign Language - Basic\nChinese Hokkien - Basic\nAfrikaans - Basic\nDinka - Basic\nNuer - Basic\nNubian - Basic\nThai - Basic\nTrinidadian Creole English - Basic\nUkrainian - Basic\nVietnamese - Basic\nKhmer - Basic\nPolish - Basic\nMongolian - Basic\nMaltese - Basic\nArmenian - Basic\nMaltese - Basic \nEstonian - Basic\nQuechua - Basic\nFrench patois - Basic\nKirundi- Basic\nBulgarian - Basic\nAymara - Basic\nGuarani - Basic','','A cool book','“What doesn’t hurt you makes you stronger with emotions needed for that of an actor made for the heavens and the earth whether it be pain or joy, anger or love, hate or evil, or good or sadness.

These Gen Z kids will soon become voters and buyers, and Gen Z and Millennials are already half the global workforce. It should be unsurprising, then, that another critical protest movement that grew this year came from employees. More than 8,700 Amazon associates signed an open letter to CEO Jeff Bezos demanding the company develop an aggressive climate action plan. Microsoft employees staged a walk-out in September to protest the company’s “complicity in the climate crisis.” This year, vegan offerings from Impossible and Beyond Meat quickly jumped from niche curiosities to featured players on the menus of Burger King and Carl’s Jr. They’re also sold in tens of thousands of grocery stores.','Red Cross\nUNICEF\nFeed America\nHabitat for Humanity\nAmerican Heart Association \nMAP International \nUnited Way\nFood for the Poor\nUnited Way\nSave the Children\nSalvation Army\nAfrican Wildlife Foundation \nPet Partners\nCarbon Fund\nCoral Reef Alliance \nAmerican Farmland Trust\nAmeriCares\nOperation Smile\nCURE International \nAFS USA\nAsia Society\nAlzheimer’s Association \nCaring Bridge\nChildren’s Defense Fund\nAmericans United \nCoalition to Stop Gun Violence \nBorn Free America \nDefenders of Wildlife \nRedRover\nMarine Mammal Center\nFriends of Animals\nBeyond Pesticides\nCarbon Fund\nCousteau Society\nEmergency Nutrition Network \nAmerican Refugee Committee\nSamaritan’s Purse\nHispanic Scholarship Fund\nScholarship America','I learned to be patient and strict at the same time from my teacher assistant position as a volunteer.

Let’s dive a little deeper and explore some other top unique fundraising ideas. \nProduct fundraisers are one of the easiest ways to raise money for just about any cause—and some of the items offered can be really unique, too! This type of fundraising campaign involves the sale of products (think cookie dough, popcorn, discount cards, or even custom-branded merchandise like travel mugs) by your supporters to their   friends and family.\nMatching gifts are a part of many corporate philanthropy policies.

By the general election, each party has only one candidate, and campaign ads must accomplish a different goal with different voters. Because most party-affiliated voters will cast a ballot for their party’s candidate, the campaigns must try to reach the independent and undecided, as well as try to convince their party members to get out and vote. Some ads will focus on issue and policy positions, comparing the two main party candidates. Other ads will remind party loyalists why it is important to vote. President Lyndon B. Johnson used the infamous “Daisy Girl” ad, which cut from a little girl counting daisy petals to an atomic bomb being dropped, to explain why voters needed to turn out and vote for him. If the voters stayed home, Johnson implied, his opponent, Republican Barry Goldwater, might start an atomic war. The ad aired once as a paid ad on NBC before it was pulled, but the footage appeared on other news stations as newscasters discussed the controversy over it.[1]  More recently, Mitt Romney used the economy to remind moderates and independents in 2012 that household incomes had dropped and the national debt increased. The ad’s goal was to reach voters who had not already decided on a candidate and would use the economy as a primary deciding factor.  Part of the reason Johnson’s campaign ad worked is that more voters turn out for a general election than for other elections.

However, I realized that making a difference does not mean that I need to solve every issue myself. Over the summer of 2020, I participated in the Pioneer Research Program and wrote a research paper on how urban gardening can empower and develop future earth stewards in the youth population. This opportunity was a big turning point in my perspective on how I viewed change. I learned that supporting one cause does not mean neglecting another. For example, by empowering the youth to become more sustainable and better caretakers for the earth by implementing community gardening programs, other issues such as crime, mental health, and more were also addressed. I learned that taking specific actions for one particular cause will benefit beyond that cause and influence the world in a better way.   I then used this newfound perspective in my local community, such as incorporating the local community near my high school as part of a recycling initiative.
