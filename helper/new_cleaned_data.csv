I really enjoy the city life and constantly being onthemove with one thing or another.","At Northeastern University I am persuing a Bachelors of Science in Economics and Pshychology. I have always been fascinated with Human Pshychology and behavior and my academic interest in it flourished when I took an introductory Psychology class at my High School. At a time like this when focus on human behavior and mental health are finally getting the attention they deserve I wanted to study this in a way that I can apply it to everyday life. The Economics and Pshychology program at Northeastern allows me to study the complexity of human behavior in an economic context. Throught this I can help implement the topics such as cognition behavior decision making and motivation in any field as economics connects the whole world.","Along with academic courses I involve myself in various other activities on and off campus. I am a leader in the Economics Society at Norhteastern and a member of Alpha Phi Omega. Through these organizations not only am I able to develop my skills and knowledge but I also connect with like minded individuals that have a similar goal for their future. I also participate with the Campus center on Violence Against Women and Vegetarians United. It is great to be part of work that is actively seeking to make a difference in the world. I am continuously trying to find new ways to apply my skills and knowledge and to learn new things.","I also enjoy playing Tennis and Basketball with the oncampus club teams. I have been a physcially active person since I was very young and sports are one of my favorite activities.","In the near future I wish to increase my knowledge and experience by studying further in pshychology. Meanwhile I would like to work with psychiatrists and scientists working to understand mental health and human behavior in relation to the corporate world. Eventually I would like to work with top level executives in companies of all industries to evaluate human pshychology and make decisions accordingly in this coporate world.","I have been fortunate to have been a Pshychology Intern at Boston Medical Center my second summer of college. Currently I am working on Health Economics  Outcomes Research at Takeda Pharmaceuticals in Boston.","","I am fluent in 3 languages including English Irish  French. I am also learning Latin in my free time.","Deans List  All Semester

I love the earth the ukulele fruit the way music and movement makes me feel. I love the night time when the world is quiet and the day time when the sun is up and the world is busy and people seem ready to feel alive. I want to support people specifically youth in finding their voice and making space for them to express themselves in a safe and open way.

Cities are big and they are crowded. They hold so many people and this means that sometimes some can fall through the cracks. As children and young adults in the city grow they can often find themselves lost in unstable home lives and the chaos of the public school system. There is often no where for these growing people to feel safe cared for and nurtured. I want to help to create a place to create a city to create a world where children feel seen and welcome to be themselves and express their loves.","For most of my life I have lived in Brooklyn New York. I made my way through public school here. When I look back I think of what a struggle school was for me and for most of my peers. How can public school transform from a system that simply tries to move students through into a place of true engagement and learning 

After high school I found myself attending Goucher College in Baltimore Maryland where I honed my love for poetry and met many friends whose strength perseverance and sweetness inspires me to this day. As beautiful as the people were there I was struggling with my mental health and I decided to take a year off to volunteer on organic farms across the U.S. This stoked my love of nature and animals. It gave me the gift of finding confidence in my ability to learn. 

For the second half of 2019 I worked at Whole Foods which taught me to live in the moment and that kindness is often found in the smallest of actions. Now I am studying at Smith College hoping to convince everyone that education isnt a clear cut path. Education never ends","","","","","","","","","","After School

I am using this time of my life to learn to work to express and understand myself and those around me. I do this so in the future I can support others in doing the same.

I do small things like make sandwiches for the local food bank visit my neighbors in the nursing home across the way hand out cookies and Snickers on the street and make my friends small gifts to show that they are loved. But I truly believe that the most beautiful and important thing that I do for the world is work on myself. Every moment matters and every action has an outcome. If I am healthy and happy then each person I meet will feel that and this will create a huge ripple in the world.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Student Organization Writers Flock Position if any Member

I eat every two hours and drink optimum amounts of water between these hours in order to keep myself hydrated and active all through the day. Due to this routine necessity I make sure that I have my own metal water container to refill every time and I dont use disposable plastic water bottles in order to reduce my non bio degradable waste. The plates and utensils that I generally use are made of metal and can reused every time after one wash. I also extensively use paper cups trays in order to serve others if my friends come over. In this way I make sure that Im creating as little of non bio degradable waste as possible.

When it comes to shopping I make sure that Im carrying a huge bag made of either cloth or jute. This helps me carry more items as well as the bags can be reused with every visit.","United Way

I am a finance major at Baruch college and still searching for a job til this day because I need money to survive to survive in this capitalist world. I have no job experience but I wish to be financially stable in the future. Therefore I am applying and working for exposure and experience as I go. I also love to write as I was an editor for my high school news paper called The Verdict.  McCainFeingold restricts the amount of money given to political parties which had become a way for companies and PACs to exert influence. It placed limits on total contributions to political parties prohibited coordination between candidates and PAC campaigns and required candidates to include personal endorsements on their political ads. The Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 BCRA also referred to as the McCainFeingold Act. McCainFeingold restricts the amount of money given to political parties which had become a way for companies and PACs to exert influence. It placed limits on total contributions to political parties prohibited coordination between candidates and PAC campaigns and required candidates to include personal endorsements on their political ads. It also limited advertisements run by unions and corporations. Soon after the passage of the McCainFeingold Act the FECs enforcement of the law spurred court cases challenging it. The first McConnell v. Federal Election Commission 2003 resulted in the Supreme Courts upholding the acts restrictions on how candidates and parties could spend campaign contributions. But later court challenges led to the removal of limits on personal spending and ended the ban on ads run by interest groups in the days leading up to an elections. The history of campaign finance monitoring has its roots in a federal law written in 1867 which prohibited government employees from employees.","I major in finance. My favorite class so far is Communication 1010 class out of all the general Eds. The Professor allows us to do any specific topic that we want except very controversial ones in exchange that we follow his speech outlines. We get to talk about the things that we love hate dislike or like passionately with the class listening and getting to know every one of us. I get to open up myself indirectly through this effective way without keeping my usual guarded posture and face where I tense if I have to be This however pales in comparison to the amounts raised by political action committees PACs which are organizations created to raise and spend money to influence politics and contribute to candidates campaigns. In the 2014 congressional elections PACs raised over 1.7 billion to help candidates and political parties.10 How does the government monitor the vast amounts of money that are now a part of the election process

The history of campaign finance monitoring has its roots in a federal law written 1867 which prohibited government employees from asking Naval Yard employees for donations. Republican Party spent about 16 million overall which includes William McKinleys 67 million campaign expenses.","I was a writer and editor for my high school newspaper The Verdict. I collaborated and directed articles for every monthly newspaper. I always pitched ideas for every article that was relevant and not too controversial. I directly corresponded to my English teacher as she was the advisor for anything in relation to the tasks at hand. I made sure to distribute the tasks between me and my partner or group members in order to meet the deadlines for each article.
Campaign managers know that to win an election they must do two things reach voters with their candidates information and get voters to show up at the polls. To accomplish these goals candidates and their campaigns will often try to target those most likely to vote. Unfortunately these voters change from election to election and sometimes from year to year. Primary and caucus voters are different from voters who vote only during presidential general elections. Some years see an increase in younger voters turning out to vote. Elections are unpredictable and campaigns must adapt to be effective. Even with a carefully planned and orchestrated presidential run early fundraising is vital for candidates. Money helps them win and the ability to.","I play tennis badminton and basketball. I also love to bike around my neighbor at least once a week. Walking around my college campus in Manhattan is an exercise that is worth it enough to explore the whole city for you could never go hungry with excitement to fill it up. I am still learning how to swim so that I could play with people my age who know how to swim well.
Although candidates have the same goal for primary and general elections which is to win these elections are very different from each other and require a very different set of strategies. Primary elections are more difficult for the voter. There are more candidates vying to become their partys nominee and party identification is not a useful cue because each party has many candidates rather than just one. In the 2016 presidential election Republican voters in the early primaries were presented with a number of options including Mike Huckabee Donald Trump Jeb Bush Ted Cruz Marco Rubio John Kasich Chris Christie Carly Fiorina Ben Carson and more. Huckabee Christie and Fiorina dropped out relatively early. Democrats had to decide between Hillary Clinton Bernie Sanders and Martin OMalley who soon dropped.","I wish to be financially stable with all of the knowledge that I am willing to learn remember and use in real life so that I could retire early without worrying over debt and family financial problems. If I am able to and could do so I wish to have all the time in the world to brush up on my hobbies of creative writing art and athletic hobbies to make something of them out in the public for these services using commissions. 
First name recognition is extremely important. Voters are unlikely to cast a vote for an unknown. Some candidates like Hillary Clinton and Jeb Bush have held or are related to someone who held national office but most candidates will be governors senators or local politicians who are less wellknown nationally. Barack Obama was a junior senator from Illinois and Bill Clinton was a governor from Arkansas prior to running for president. Voters across the country had little information about them and both candidates needed media time to become known. While wellknown candidates have longer records that can be attacked by the opposition they also have an easier time raising campaign funds because their odds of winning better.","I have held no jobs so far. But I do have work experience for Changing the Present only. I have managed a project on my own where I researched and analyzed information and contact information for the College Scholarships for High School Students spreadsheet. I was the one who handled communication between Robert and the team members in the Active Projects for SYEP. From the SYEP project spreadsheet I also made sure to correct all the data entry errors that I saw.
Early in the 2016 election season several candidates had fundraised well ahead of their opponents. Hillary Clinton Jeb Bush and Ted Cruz were the top fundraisers by July 2015. Clinton reported 47 million Cruz with 14 million and Bush with 11 million in contributions. In comparison Bobby Jindal and George Pataki who both dropped out relatively early each reported less than 1 million in contributions during the same period. Bush later reported over 100 million in contributions while the other Republican candidates continued to report lower contributions. Media stories about Bushs fundraising discussed his powerful financial networking while coverage of the other candidates focused on their lack of money. Donald Trump the eventual Republican nominee showed a comparatively low fundraising because he was selffunded.","Critical thinking","English  Native or bilingual

Young people are leading the way on climate action and business should take note. These Gen Z kids will soon become voters and buyers and Gen Z and Millennials are already half the global workforce. It should be unsurprising then that another critical protest movement that grew this year came from employees. More than 8700 Amazon associates signed an open letter to CEO Jeff Bezos demanding the company develop an aggressive climate action plan. Microsoft employees staged a walkout in September to protest the companys complicity in the climate crisis. This year vegan offerings from Impossible and Beyond Meat quickly jumped from niche curiosities to featured players on the menus of Burger King and Carls Jr. Theyre also sold in tens of thousands of grocery stores.","Red Cross

I had to be the one in charge if the teacher was not able to or was absent as I had to be strict as the children were at the age of almost puberty and could easily rebel at anything if there were not a strict authority figure. I demonstrated organization skills through my work as a grader for all of the students homework assignments tests and report cards.

By the general election each party has only one candidate and campaign ads must accomplish a different goal with different voters. Because most partyaffiliated voters will cast a ballot for their partys candidate the campaigns must try to reach the independent and undecided as well as try to convince their party members to get out and vote. Some ads will focus on issue and policy positions comparing the two main party candidates. Other ads will remind party loyalists why it is important to vote. President Lyndon B. Johnson used the infamous Daisy Girl ad which cut from a little girl counting daisy petals to an atomic bomb being dropped to explain why voters needed to turn out and vote for him. If the voters stayed home Johnson implied his opponent Republican Barry Goldwater might start an atomic war. The ad aired once as a paid ad on NBC before it was pulled but the footage appeared on other news stations as newscasters discussed the controversy over it.1  More recently Mitt Romney used the economy to remind moderates and independents in 2012 that household incomes had dropped and the national debt increased. The ads goal was to reach voters who had not already decided on a candidate and would use the economy as a primary deciding factor.  Part of the reason Johnsons campaign ad worked is that more voters turn out for a general election than for other elections. Be be.","www.swimcloud.com","","",""

News articles detailing the most recent disaster would stay with me throughout the day oftentimes paralyzing me even. I felt powerless in that there were too many issues to support.  However I realized that making a difference does not mean that I need to solve every issue myself. Over the summer of 2020 I participated in the Pioneer Research Program and wrote a research paper on how urban gardening can empower and develop future earth stewards in the youth population. This opportunity was a big turning point in my perspective on how I viewed change. I learned that supporting one cause does not mean neglecting another. For example by empowering the youth to become more sustainable and better caretakers for the earth by implementing community gardening programs other issues such as crime mental health and more were also addressed. I learned that taking specific actions for one particular cause will benefit beyond that cause and influence the world in a better way.   I then used this newfound perspective in my local community such as incorporating the local community near my high school as part of a recycling initiative.  So for me making a difference does not mean that I have to fix everything at once and it also doesnt mean that by focusing on one cause I am neglecting others.","","","",""
